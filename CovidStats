                At a time when Thailand is faced with a tough battle against COVID-19
                and new variants, it’s more important than ever for health authorities
                to relay important messages to the Thai and non-Thai population
                – especially with the two million workers from neighbouring countries
                including Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.
                Health literacy plays a crucial role in helping to reduce transmission
                and allows the public to understand how the virus spreads and know how
                to protect themselves against it. The WHO and implementing partners
                embarked on a project to translate a guide to COVID-19 vaccines
                from Thai into English, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese.
                This comprehensive guide provides details about the virus and its
                variants as well as vaccines – the key to ending this pandemic.
